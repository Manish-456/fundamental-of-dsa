// ? TREE

/* -> A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

   -> A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structure

   -> In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set.

   -> Trees however, owing to the non-linear nature, allow quicker and easier access to the data

   -> A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.

// ? TREE USAGE
/* -> File systems for directory structure
   -> A family tree
   -> An organization tree
   -> DOM
